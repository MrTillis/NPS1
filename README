Important info for the Server classes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In SController.java, the subclass "ServerThread" is the code for a server thread to match a Client thread. It is called 
from Runnable object called "Runnable run = new Runnable()" in enterAction() under the "EnterListener" subclass.

The get methods required for the menu are located under the subclass "Server." I assume we can use these... if not, then
we can alwayse change them.

I currently have a netstat method underway in getNetstat(). If you open the server and type in --netstat or -n in the
command line, you should see the netstat appear in the display. The trick now is to get that to occour from the client
side, by sending a request to the server to retreive the data.

The method, getTime(), is currently fully functinal and operational across both Server and client. Type --time or -t to
use it in the command line. That's one part o fthe menu fuly functinal...

The Server is designed to handle multiple Client Threads.

A quick note: to get the name of the current Client thread being handled by the Server, look at the line of code:

  clientcmd = in.readLine();
  
That is the part of the code where the Server waits for a command from the Client Thread.
Use this code to get the name of said Client thread:

  clientcmd = this.getName();
